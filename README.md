# TUI to unwatch GitHub repositories
Small terminal application that allows to unwatch repositories with a better UX than [GitHub Watching](https://github.com/watching) page.
You need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with at least `notifications` and `read:user` scopes, and export it to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
Mark with `space` whichever repository you want to unwatch, press `x`, and profit.
